MICROSOFT SQL SERVER

SELECT * 
FROM Population

--population by year 
SELECT Year, ROUND(SUM([Total persons]), 2) as Total_population
FROM Population
GROUP by Year
ORDER BY Year

--old age population
SELECT Year, ROUND(SUM([85 and over]),2) AS over_85, ROUND(SUM([80-84]),2) as a80_84, ROUND(SUM([75-79]),2) as b75_79,

GROUP by Year
ORDER BY Year

--alphabets are added infront of the renamed columns as the server did not handle numbers as column names well. 

Now looking at the admissions data

**ADMISSIONS 20-21
SELECT Year, State, Care_type, Admission_type, First_admission, Age_group, Sex
FROM Admissions

--Total first admissions by state and age group
/*SELECT State, Age_group, COUNT(Age_group) as Total
FROM Admissions
WHERE First_admission = 'Yes'
GROUP BY State, Age_group
ORDER BY Age_group

SELECT State, Age_group, COUNT(Age_group) as Total
FROM Admissions
WHERE First_admission = 'No'
GROUP BY State, Age_group
ORDER BY Age_group*/

--I want to look at an overview for the whole AU, hence I decided to exclude the state segregation for easier data visualisation
SELECT Year, Admission_type, First_admission, Age_group, COUNT(Sex) as Total_admissions
FROM Admissions
--WHERE First_admission='Yes'
GROUP BY Year, Admission_type, First_admission, Age_group
ORDER BY Age_group

**People using aged care from 2019 to 2020
SELECT *
FROM using_aged_care_2019

/*
